### *Ancient Greece: 6th century AD*

**Colchis, Thursday June 15th**

In the luxury palace of Colchis, Pollux, your Front-end Developer, and Serverux, your Back-end Developer are just like small children, all excited and bickering in the large corridors.

The king gave you the best high tech equipment: 50 computers and a server room, all connected to the FCFC (Fast Colchis Fiber-optic Cable), the best network of ancient Greece.

You have no time to waste, the Demo Day where you will present the last version is planned for Friday night and 3 500 famous people have already been invited (Anna Stepanoff, the President of the most famous tech school in Europe is one of them!)

Pollux already started designing the structure of the website and what features should be included. You are brainstorming ideas on how to go about coding the website and bringing it to life.

The technical challenge:

### **What you have to do**



**Create the King’s website** using the wireframes provided by Pollux as a structural guide. You will need to use HTML and CSS and CodeSandbox (online code editor) to create the website.

To help you, we’ve provided a skeleton of the website in the CodeSandbox code editor below. Before you start coding, **don't forget to create an account if haven't done it yet** and make a copy of this template by creating a 'Fork' (a copy of the template). **Otherwise, you may lose all your work** and you won't be able to retrieve it.

```codesandbox

```

The CSS section is blank. It‘s up to you to customize your website, but don‘t forget that we are not focusing on your design skills in the technical interview, but more specifically on your ability to learn how to write HTML and CSS. You don‘t have to add any JavaScript, but it is certainly encouraged!

### Features to include in your website:

**Required features:**

* A navigation bar on each page, structured as a list using the `ul` and `li` tags, linked to relevant pages in your website
* A hero section on the home page (index.html) displaying a heading welcoming users to the site (try including a CSS background-image or background-color)
* A ‘Royal Family’ page, displaying the top 3 members of the royal family, placed side by side (Hint: try using Flexbox for the positioning)
* An HTML table displaying the kingdom’s royal assets or a royal sporting event schedule (You're free to be creative here!)
* A contact page with a form (to contact the kingdom) with explicit `<labels>` (Hint: Use the “for” attribute on the label element, linking it to the id of the input field)
* To be sure to have a clean, robust and compliant HTML code, we ask you to pass all HTML pages into the [W3C validator https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). No any errors should remain.


* A popup message upon submission of the form (using the JavaScript alert method)
* Include a Google font to spruce up the page (Recommended [guide](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp))

You are encouraged to be creative and use your imagination so that the public will flock to the Kingdom and boost the King’s popularity. The wireframes are only a guide.

### Submit your work

**Insert the CodeSandbox URL (link) as your solution** at the bottom of the page for us to view it (in the box **Link to your solution")**. **We look forward to discussing your website with you in the tech interview.**

**Ancient Greece: 6th century AD**
**Iolcus, Friday Saturday 17th**

48 hours later, in the palace of Colchis, lyres and zithers are playing a magnificent song of Mesomed hymn. A beautiful papyrus carpet is welcoming the stars.
It just looks like the Cannes Film Festival in France. But this time, there is no actress or actor, just you with your 50 Argonauts all aligned on the stage receiving your prize under the public acclaim. You made it. Your website won the Golden Palm award and you got the award of the Best Director. Odysseys, the President of the ceremony is happy to give you the precious Golden Fleece as a well-deserved reward.

Looking at your feet, you completely forgot you were still wearing one sandal! It doesn't matter now. You actually found Jason's future. He will not marry the princess. A the Demo Day, you met Anna Stepanoff, the President of Wild Code School. You are now convinced that you and Jason can make very good Web Developpers.  It turned out that at Wild Code School, students go to class without shoes. Just for you. “When the feet are free, the spirit is also free”.

As for you future Wilder, if you are reading this, it means that you have reached the end of this expedition and that you have created your first website. Don't forget to submit your work and be prepared to present it to our instructor during the technical interview . Who knows? You might win a treasure far more important than the Golden Fleece: a place at the Wild Code School, the best school in ancient Greece!
